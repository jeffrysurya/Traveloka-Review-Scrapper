        "Review": "The place is falling apart. After checking stepping off the elevator I'm greeted with 2 beds in the hallway. They store them there. Followed by a huge hole in the roof covered by steal. The first room was filthy. Walls had things dripping on them. Not from ceiling down but from 1/2 way down. The place hasn't been cleaned in years. The window was bad. The bathroom toilet didn't flush there was no shower handle to rest the hand held unit. And that's not even the worst. While showering my friend bumped his shoulder on the glass shelf they placed unsafely in the shower and it broke falling onto the sink which then also broke. Yes the sink fell apart. We immediately called the staff who came up and only looked the sink. Didn't ask if my friend was cut or okay. They just said the manager will talk to us. We shifted that night to another room. Which was equally dirty. Walls were totally disgusting and shower water pressure was 0 with again no place to put the handle. It just left to dangle. We honestly felt it was a broken down building that was unsafe. The breakfast was for Indonesians. No bread eggs or juice. Just water and coffee and tea. With filthy environment. Lastly the aircon hadn't been cleaned snd so I coughed all night.. As for the broken sink the manager didn't charge us. Which was the only positive experience. Which was good as we paid 100,000 more each night than the local rate. I'm sorry for such a harsh review but honestly the building is falling apart literally and they obviously don't care. It has potential but right now it's not safe. By the way my friend cut his foot on the glass but not bad thank God. "

This hotel is just so-so, well it's ok if you only need some bnb for a night, but better move to other hotel if you plan to stay more than a night. But don't worry, the hotel staffs are so nice so you can ask them to get you new bedsheet :)"

        "Review": "The bedroom is spacious, food is great, pretty clean bathroom but bathtub size is quite small. Staffs are friendly, but I think they lack of people. However, there is a serious concern. This hotel need to focus on their building maintenance. I see some cracks and molds on the wall, especially in the bathroom, it'd appear disgusting for some people. It doesn't bother me honestly, but it's a big disappointment for a Deluxe Room. Because of this, the room becomes kinda pricey. And for a 3 stars hotel, this is a major issue. But overall, my whole experience was pretty good. I enjoyed my stay and thank you."

First I parked in the basement and it was very scary, the glass and the door to the elevator door were broken and almost collapsed. The dark lights and the roof are lots of holes. Once the exit from the elevator on the 2nd floor (lobby) is greeted with people who are working on repairing the hydrant channel. I swear I was shocked because at first I was frightened by the creepy atmosphere of the hotel. Once I go to FO, I smell the scent of a hotel that is not good, like the smell of dust or whatever. And finally I got room no. 609 on the floor. 5. Once out of the elevator I am still feeling very scared, especially when I am in the dark hallway. And it looks like at that time only we were on the floor. 5. For the bedroom sundiri the sheets are worn and there are spots. Poor service. I think the room lights are very dim, in the bathroom the water is dirty, then the breakfast is not tasty, the menu is only chicken balado, fried noodles, capcay, mendoan, Kerupuk, bean porridge, fresh bread, pudding, drink orange, water, coffee, tea. it&#39;s just that. So don&#39;t get a higher price. Maybe the first time this hotel stood was very good in its time, but along with the development of my era I think this hotel has been very left behind. So the point is it&#39;s quite enough to stay here and don&#39;t want to come again. just disappointed. And at that time we actually canceled but couldn&#39;t, already already."

The food is in accordance with the information that there are extended by others. Menginan is very simple only 1/2 egg, noodles, tofu, oseng. Drink water, coffee tea, cut fruit. There is no other choice. The interior in the room needs to be renovated, the sheets are torn, the air conditioner is less cold, the bathtub has been peeled off, the room is rather stuffy, the closet is not there, there is only a hanger. The pillow is gone. But it&#39;s not scary. Only it really needs renovation so it will be more fresh. The receptionist was fierce early in the morning already wanting to call the phone at maximum at 12 check-out, but that&#39;s the cheap price according to what he got.

The sound of the next room was noisy, the wall was knocked, so it was disturbed while sleeping at night. Second, there is no shower for the toilet. There is only tissue. Even though (sorry) you need to use the tissue first and then go to the shower. It was also a short shower, not long so I had to take a shower. What if the business is only to dispose of water, because a short shower is only up to the body, not to the bottom. Not when I squat down. Take a shower again, huh? \ud83d\ude01 The trash can should be placed in the bathroom as well, so that the tissue that is used is directly used, the trash can. Moreover, tissue has been used to urinate. So that I don&#39;t save the tissue first until the bath is finished throwing away. Hmm, the toilet is dirty too. The third one is only one piece of toothpaste, even though the capacity for 2 guests is actually very simple, ngirit.com. Breakfast menu? hmm, not bad. Alhamdulillah, I can have breakfast.

Remotes are also more concerned, yes, ac and tv remotes. Because you can't press all of them. The ac is also not too cold because I wake up sweating. Others are safe. The only thing that I regret is, I made a reservation for a king bed type mattress, but at the location there were twins. Maybe next time I can confirm again. For breakfast, that's all. With a price of 300 maybe other variants can be added."

The toilet is not like in the picture that shows there is a bathtub, but it turns out that it is just a normal shower, even then the water is jammed if it&#39;s more than 8 in the morning. The toilet, really dirty, mossy. The floor of the room which is coated with PVC wood motifs is also a lot of peeling. Standard breakfast menu only. Not bad. Friendly employees.
